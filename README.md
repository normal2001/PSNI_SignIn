# PSNI Sign-In Android App

A simple Kotlin/Android application for visitor sign-in/sign-out tracking using a local SQLite database and best-effort CSV exports to an SMB fileshare using **SMBJ 0.13.0**.
It is intended to be installed on an Android 16 tablet in kiosk mode (app pinning).

## Installation

The debug build signed installer package is usually named `app-debug.apk`.

1. On the device, download the installer package from a network source or shared with the device via a USB connection.
2. Open the installer package
3. Since the package is not coming from Google Play Store, you may need to select "Allow from this source" in the Download Manager settings.
4. Additional pop-up warnings may need to be accepted to allow installation from untrusted sources.

## CSV exports to SMB fileshare (optional)

SMB requirements:

- SMB2/SMB3-capable server reachable from the Android device.
- TCP 445 reachable from the Android network to the server.
- Configured SMB account has permission to create directories and overwrite the CSV in the configured share/path.
- The app has Android `INTERNET` permission (already declared).

After every successful database **sign-in**, **sign-out**, or **admin edit**, the app queues a background write to a CSV file (`PSNI_Sign-In_Sheet_YYYY.csv`) on an SMB fileshare, if enabled. If not enabled, the records are only visible within the application. The CSV exporter rebuilds the entire current-year CSV and overwrites it. This ensures that any records are not missing if the CSV export option was temporarily disabled or fails to be written. The 'YYYY' in the filename represents the current year, so this file will rollover to a new file name each year.

The default yearly CSV columns are exactly:

`sign_in_datetime,sign_out_datetime,first_name,last_name,visiting,reason`

`visiting` contains the selected host's display name at sign-in, or `Other`.
`reason` contains the reason for the visit. Missing historical values are exported as empty fields.

SQLite is the local source of truth. If SMB is unavailable, authentication fails, or the remote file cannot be written, the local database transaction stays committed and the SMB problem is written to `psni_sign_in_error.txt`.

The Fileshare tab's **Export CSV** button generates a current-year export from SQLite
in the share root with a timestamped filename such as:

`PSNI_Sign-In_Sheet_2026-09-04-134205_export.csv`

The timestamped export contains only:

`sign_in_datetime,sign_out_datetime,first_name,last_name`

Neither `visiting` nor `reason` is included in its header or rows. If the default
yearly CSV is missing, the app also creates that file with all six columns. An existing
yearly CSV is left unchanged by the Export CSV button; normal sign-in, sign-out, or admin
edits rebuild it with all six columns. Empty exports contain just their respective headers.
The page reports whether the export succeeded or failed. Existing timestamped exports
are not rewritten.

## Slack notifications (optional)

### Slack requirements:

-   Slack app/bot and token with specific OAuth scoped permissions
-   Slack user group for displaying members in the app and sending
    individual notifications
-   Slack channel for sending a broadcast notification instead of
    individual

### Create a new Slack app:

1.  https://api.slack.com/apps/, click on "Create New App", then choose
    "Starter App"
2.  Give the app a name, such as "PSNI Sign-in" or "Sign-in
    notification"
3.  Select the appropriate Workspace
4.  Click "Review App" and then the "Create and Install"
5.  Under OAuth & Permissions, copy the installed app's Bot User OAuth Token
    (not an app configuration token).
6.  Copy/save the token for later usage inside of the PNSI_Sign_in
    application settings.

### Update bot token permissions:

-   https://api.slack.com/apps, click the new app name to manage the
    app/bot
-   Click on "OAuth & Permissions" and scroll down to the "Scopes"
    section
-   Confirm the following permissions exist or click "Add an OAuth
    Scope" as needed:
    -   `usergroups:read` and `users:read` permissions to refresh the
        user cache.
    -   `chat:write` - used for both channel and individual messages
    -   `im:write` - used for Individual user notification delivery

### Create a Slack user group:

1.  https://slack.com/admin/user_groups, click on "Edit User Groups" and
    then "Create a new group"
2.  Name (display name)
3.  Handle (@ can be used to get the entire group's attention)
4.  Purpose (text description)
5.  Default channels (automatically add user group members to an
    optional broadcast notification channel)
6.  Click "Create Group"
7.  Click on Edit Group Members for the new group to invite each user to
    the group.

When Slack notifications are enabled, application startup and saving Admin settings query
the configured Slack user group in the background. Its user IDs and display names are cached
in the local SQLite `slack_group_user_cache` table. A failed refresh retains the last
successful cache. The cached names populate the "Who are you visiting?" dropdown in name
order, with "Other" always last and selected by default. When Slack is disabled or no
matching cache exists, only Other is shown. A refresh preserves the current selection by
user ID; if that person is removed, selection returns to Other. The cache is scoped to the
bot token and group, so changing either does not display recipients from the previous configuration.

When Slack notifications are enabled, each successful sign-in either posts once to the configured
channel (the default delivery mode) or sends a direct message to the cached Slack user selected in the
"Who are you visiting?" dropdown. The Other option has no Slack user ID, so individual delivery is
skipped and logged for that selection. Slack runs in the background; lookup or delivery failures are
written to the error log and never roll back a successful local sign-in.

Notification attempts, successes, and skips are recorded in the audit log.

### Offline Slack verification

The emulator checks use isolated test settings and intercept all HTTPS calls with fake
Slack responses. They cover cache rollback and scope isolation, failed and empty refreshes,
disabled notifications, Other, channel delivery, individual delivery, and saved settings.
They also verify visiting-column migrations, saved host preservation, both CSV formats,
CSV escaping, and empty exports.
Using a local Gradle installation and an emulator, run:

```text
gradle :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
adb shell am instrument -w com.example.psnisignin.test/com.example.psnisignin.SlackFeatureInstrumentation
```

The runner prints `PASS` or `FAIL` with details. It does not run the normal application
startup integrations or send live Slack messages.

## Audit logging

Successful database transaction types are appended to `psni_sign_in_audit.txt` with timestamps:

- `sign-in`
- `sign-out`
- `admin-edit`

When signing out users from the Admin page using the "Sign Out" button, this is audited as `sign-out` 
because it performs the same transaction type.


## Build/import

1. Clone the GitHub project into the renamed folder with `git clone https://github.com/normal2001/PSNI_SignIn.git PSNI_SignIn`, or extract a downloaded .zip file into a folder named `PSNI_SignIn`.
2. Open the `PSNI_SignIn` folder in Android Studio.
3. Let Android Studio sync Gradle and download dependencies from Google Maven/Maven Central.
4. Install Android SDK 36 if Android Studio requests it.
5. Use JDK 17.
6. Set the SMB values in `AppConfig_test.properties` or from the Fileshare admin tab before testing SMB export.
7. Build and run on Android 8.0 (API 26) or newer.

The project specifies Android Gradle Plugin 9.2.1, Kotlin 2.3.21, Gradle 9.4.1, compile/target SDK 36, and SMBJ 0.13.0.

> The standard `gradle-wrapper.jar` binary is intentionally not included in this generated source archive. Android Studio can import/sync the project directly. If you want command-line `./gradlew` usage, generate/add the wrapper from Android Studio or a local Gradle installation.

## Important configuration

Deployment defaults are defined in `app/build.gradle.kts` and exposed through
`app/src/main/java/com/example/psnisignin/AppConfig.kt`.

### Debugging using local test properties:

1. Edit `AppConfig_test.properties` in the project root. On a fresh clone, copy
   `AppConfig_test.example.properties` to that name first.
2. Use the exact keys shown in the example, with one `KEY=value` per line. All
   administrator settings, the reason choices, and `useMockData` are supported.
3. Sync Gradle and rebuild/run the **debug** variant after making changes.

This `AppConfig_test.properties` file is ignored by Git so your custom settings
remain local only.

Debug setting precedence: 
  1. any settings saved through the admin screen
  2. the `AppConfig_test.properties` settings
  3. the app defaults. 

The `AppConfig_test.properties` settings work as initial values for debugging, but 
any changes saved inside the app take priority and survive app restarts and normal
rebuilds/reinstalls that retain app data. The `REASON_OPTIONS` and `useMockData` are
build settings without saved admin overrides. Changing local properties requires
rebuilding and installing the app; restarting the emulator app alone does not update
it or erase saved settings. 

Release builds ignore the local properties file entirely. Release builds and debug
builds without local overrides use empty Slack connection credentials and disabled
SMB fileshare exports by default. The default admin passcode remains `1234`.
Previously saved settings take priority in both debug and release builds.

Properties are read as UTF-8. Do not surround values with quotes. Use `\\` for a
literal backslash and `\n` for a newline. Separate `REASON_OPTIONS` with `|`.
Booleans must
be `true` or `false`; unknown keys or invalid values cause a debug build error.
`useMockData` only exposes a flag; the app currently has no mock-data implementation.
 
Local credentials are excluded from source control, but are included in your debug
APK. If credentials previously committed to Git were real, rotate them; ignoring a
file does not remove credentials from earlier commits.

Default reasons are `Servers/Network`, `Utilities maintenance`, `Inspection/Audit`,
and `Emergency repairs`.

Default local filenames are:

- `DATABASE_PATH=psni_sign_in.db`
- `AUDIT_LOG_PATH=psni_sign_in_audit.txt`
- `ERROR_LOG_PATH=psni_sign_in_error.txt`

Saved administrator path overrides still take precedence. Selecting a new database
filename opens or creates that database; it does not migrate the old database. Before upgrading an existing installation to these filenames, back up its database and either keep its saved database path or migrate the database to the new path. Existing CSV exports and log files are not renamed automatically.
Set `SLACK_NOTIFICATION_TARGET=Channel` (default) or `Individuals`, and set
`SLACK_USER_GROUP` to a group ID or @handle. Both can also be saved in the Admin tab.
Channel delivery requires a channel; individual delivery requires a user group.
Both require a bot token when enabled.

### Android local-path behavior

If the SQLite database file cannot be opened at startup, the home page displays a
warning and disables check-in/check-out. The Settings button and admin passcode 
remain usable; login opens Application settings directly. Visitor records and CSV
export are unavailable until database access is restored. Save a corrected 
`DATABASE_PATH` to retry immediately. Failed attempts keep settings accessible. A 
successful retry opens or creates the database and re-enables check-in/check-out
when you return Home. Existing records are not copied from the old database. Changing
the path while a working database is already open still requires a full app restart.

Android does not provide a dependable writable process working directory. The app
interprets relative paths such as `./psni_sign_in_audit.txt`, `./psni_sign_in_error.txt`,
and `./psni_sign_in.db` relative to the app's private internal files directory. Absolute
paths are accepted by the resolver, but Android storage/scoped-storage permissions
still apply.

In the Admin screen's Application tab, the **View** button beside `AUDIT_LOG_PATH` or
`ERROR_LOG_PATH` opens that log in the default text-viewing app (or Android's app
picker when no default is selected). Save edited paths first. The viewer receives
temporary read-only access to the selected log. Missing or unreadable logs and a
missing text viewer are reported in the tab.

## Data model

SQLite table: `sign_in_records`

- `id` - auto-incrementing primary key
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `sign_in_datetime`
- `sign_out_datetime` - NULL while the person remains signed in
- `visiting` - host display name captured at sign-in, or Other; NULL when unknown
- `reason` - reason for the visit

The app adds a nullable `visiting` column to databases that lack it, preserving existing
records. Older databases that already have this column retain their historical values.
Host names remain as recorded even if Slack names change later. Admin edits and sign-out
preserve the saved host. The legacy Slack cache table is left intact; the scoped cache
uses a separate table to avoid assumptions about legacy cache schemas.

Timestamp format: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`

## Security notes

This project follows the requested source-level configurable passcode and SMB credentials. For a production deployment, hard-coded secrets are not strong secret storage: APK contents can be inspected. Prefer managed configuration and Android Keystore-backed secret storage if the application will be distributed beyond a controlled device fleet.

The 4-digit passcode is a convenience gate, not strong authentication. Admin Activities are marked `android:exported="false"`, reducing direct launch exposure from other apps.
